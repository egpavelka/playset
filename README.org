:PROPERTIES:
:notes: identical query works in graphiql, so this is client-side
:solution: httpLink had been left out of Client link (ApolloLink from stateLink
and httpLink), so server wasn't linked--why was there no error?
*** ○ User authentication is broken since move to apollo-link-state
* Focus: Media Player - React/Redux
